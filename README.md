# Features
* Supported Models
  * [x] [openai/whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)
    * > Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multi-task model that can perform multilingual speech recognition as well as speech translation and language identification.
  * [x] [linto-ai/whisper-timestamped](https://github.com/linto-ai/whisper-timestamped)
    * > Multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition with word-level timestamps and confidence
  * [x] [ggerganov/whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) (using [ absadiki/pywhispercpp](https://github.com/absadiki/pywhispercpp))
    * > High-performance inference of OpenAI's Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) model
      > * Plain C/C++ implementation without dependencies
      > * Runs on the CPU
  * [x] [guillaumekln/faster-whisper](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper)
    * > faster-whisper is a reimplementation of OpenAI's Whisper model using [CTranslate2](https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2/), which is a fast inference engine for Transformer models.
      >
      > This implementation is up to 4 times faster than [openai/whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) for the same accuracy while using less memory. The efficiency can be further improved with 8-bit quantization on both CPU and GPU.
  * [x] [m-bain/whisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX)
    * >fast automatic speech recognition (70x realtime with large-v2) with word-level timestamps and speaker diarization.
      >  - ⚡️ Batched inference for 70x realtime transcription using whisper large-v2
      >  - 🪶 [faster-whisper](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper) backend, requires <8GB gpu memory for large-v2 with beam_size=5
      >  - 🎯 Accurate word-level timestamps using wav2vec2 alignment
      >  - 👯‍♂️ Multispeaker ASR using speaker diarization from [pyannote-audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio) (speaker ID labels) 
      >  - 🗣️ VAD preprocessing, reduces hallucination & batching with no WER degradation.
  * [x] [jianfch/stable-ts](https://github.com/jianfch/stable-ts)
    * >**Stabilizing Timestamps for Whisper**: This library modifies [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) to produce more reliable timestamps and extends its functionality.
  * [x] [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/tasks/automatic-speech-recognition)
    * > Hugging Face implementation of Whisper.  Any speech recognition pretrained model from the Hugging Face hub can be used as well.
  * [x] [API/openai/whisper](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text)
    * > OpenAI Whisper via their API. Or any other openai-like API for whisper (e.g. [speaches.ai](https://github.com/speaches-ai/speaches))

# Installation 
* Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)

_Quoted from the official openai/whisper installation_
> It requires the command-line tool [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be installed on your system, which is available from most package managers:
> ```bash
> # on Ubuntu or Debian
> sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
>
> # on Arch Linux
>sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
>
> # on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
> brew install ffmpeg
>
> # on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/)
> choco install ffmpeg
>
> # on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/)
> scoop install ffmpeg
>```
>You may need [`rust`](http://rust-lang.org) installed as well, in case [tokenizers](https://pypi.org/project/tokenizers/) does not provide a pre-built wheel for your platform. If you see installation errors during the `pip install` command above, please follow the [Getting started page](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) to install Rust development environment. Additionally, you may need to configure the `PATH` environment variable, e.g. `export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"`. If the installation fails with `No module named 'setuptools_rust'`, you need to install `setuptools_rust`, e.g. by running:
>```bash
>pip install setuptools-rust
>``` 

* Once ffmpeg is installed, install `subsai`

```shell
# Install base package (no backends — lightweight, fast install)
pip install git+https://github.com/absadiki/subsai.git

# Install with a specific backend only
pip install "git+https://github.com/absadiki/subsai.git#egg=subsai[faster-whisper]"
pip install "git+https://github.com/absadiki/subsai.git#egg=subsai[whisper]"
pip install "git+https://github.com/absadiki/subsai.git#egg=subsai[stable-ts]"

# Install multiple backends
pip install "git+https://github.com/absadiki/subsai.git#egg=subsai[faster-whisper,api]"

# Install everything (all backends + web UI — old behavior)
pip install "git+https://github.com/absadiki/subsai.git#egg=subsai[all]"

# Install the web UI
pip install "git+https://github.com/absadiki/subsai.git#egg=subsai[webui]"
```

Available extras: `whisper`, `faster-whisper`, `stable-ts`, `whisperx`, `timestamped`, `whisper-cpp`, `transformers`, `api`, `webui`, `all`

> [!NOTE]
> * It is recommended to use Python 3.10 or 3.11. Versions 3.12 or later may have compatibility issues.
> * If torch is unable to detect your GPU devices during your usage of subsai, assuming you have a supported GPU device, there is a chance that `pip` installed the CPU version of torch. You can install a torch version with CUDA support by following the [get started locally guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) on pytorch.
> For more information, see https://github.com/absadiki/subsai/issues/162.

# Usage
### Web-UI

To use the web-UI, run the following command on the terminal
```shell
subsai-webui
```
And a web page will open on your default browser, otherwise navigate to the links provided by the command

You can also run the Web-UI using [Docker](#docker).

### CLI

```shell

              [-tc TRANSLATION_CONFIGS] [-tsl TRANSLATION_SOURCE_LANG] [-ttl TRANSLATION_TARGET_LANG]
              media_file [media_file ...]

positional arguments:
  media_file            The path of the media file, a list of files, or a text file containing paths for batch processing.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -m MODEL, --model MODEL
                        The transcription AI models. Available models: ['openai/whisper', 'linto-ai/whisper-timestamped']
  -mc MODEL_CONFIGS, --model-configs MODEL_CONFIGS
                        JSON configuration (path to a json file or a direct string)
  -f FORMAT, --format FORMAT, --subtitles-format FORMAT
                        Output subtitles format, available formats ['.srt', '.ass', '.ssa', '.sub', '.json', '.txt', '.vtt']
  -df DESTINATION_FOLDER, --destination-folder DESTINATION_FOLDER
                        The directory where the subtitles will be stored, default to the same folder where the media file(s) is stored.
  -tm TRANSLATION_MODEL, --translation-model TRANSLATION_MODEL
                        Translate subtitles using AI models, available models: ['facebook/m2m100_418M', 'facebook/m2m100_1.2B',
                        'facebook/mbart-large-50-many-to-many-mmt']
  -tc TRANSLATION_CONFIGS, --translation-configs TRANSLATION_CONFIGS
                        JSON configuration (path to a json file or a direct string)
  -tsl TRANSLATION_SOURCE_LANG, --translation-source-lang TRANSLATION_SOURCE_LANG
                        Source language of the subtitles
  -ttl TRANSLATION_TARGET_LANG, --translation-target-lang TRANSLATION_TARGET_LANG
                        Target language of the subtitles


```

Example of a simple usage
```shell
subsai ./assets/test1.mp4 --model openai/whisper --model-configs '{"model_type": "small"}' --format srt
```
> Note: **For Windows CMD**, You will need to use the following :
> `subsai ./assets/test1.mp4 --model openai/whisper --model-configs "{\"model_type\": \"small\"}" --format srt`

You can also provide a simple text file for batch processing 
_(Every line should contain the absolute path to a single media file)_

```shell
subsai media.txt --model openai/whisper --format srt
```

### From Python

To install:
1. `git clone https://github.com/absadiki/subsai`
2. `cd subsai`
3. `pip install -e ".[faster-whisper]"` (or whichever backend you need)

*Note: Install only the backends you need to avoid dependency conflicts. Use `pip install -e ".[all]"` to install everything.*

```python
from subsai import SubsAI

file = './assets/test1.mp4'
subs_ai = SubsAI()
model = subs_ai.create_model('openai/whisper', {'model_type': 'base'})
subs = subs_ai.transcribe(file, model)
subs.save('test1.srt')
```
For more advanced usage, read [the documentation](https://absadiki.github.io/subsai/).

# Notes
* If you have an NVIDIA graphics card, you may need to install [cuda](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/#installation-guides) to use the GPU capabilities.
